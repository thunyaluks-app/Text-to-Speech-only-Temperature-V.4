export const EXAMPLE_SCRIPT = `Struggling with a chaotic mind??? This isn't just ancient wisdom; it's the Buddha's precise, step-by-step path to ending suffering and finding unshakeable inner peace, starting today.
Hello and welcome.
Today we're diving into the Buddhist path to inner peace.
But I want you to think of this less as a religion
and more like a practical training manual for your own mind.
It's a step-by-step guide for cultivating a real lasting sense of well-being.
So let's get started.
You know,
it's a question I think a lot of us ask ourselves.
In a world that just feels so chaotic sometimes.
How do we actually find a stable center?
Well, this ancient path scribed in the Tripitaka or the Pali Canon
offers a surprisingly clear step-by-step approach.
And it all begins by looking directly at a fundamental truth of our experience.
This quote really gets to the heart of it.
The whole path starts with one core observation.
Life involves suffering.
And look,
we're not just talking about big, major tragedies.
It's also that subtle background noise of dissatisfaction,
the stress that comes from just wanting things to be different than they are.
The moment we can acknowledge this reality,
we can actually start to do something about it.
So, where do we even begin?
You might think it starts with some complex meditation, right?
But nope,
it's actually something way more fundamental.
Before we can even begin to train the mind,
we need to build a stable, solid foundation for it to rest on.
And that starts with giving and morality.
The very first step is Dana, which means generosity.
Dana or giving is considered the easiest way to condition the mind.
It requires little time and effort,
resulting in a refined, clear, and light mind,
achieving a certain level of ease.
True giving is giving with sincere goodwill to the recipient,
without expecting anything in return,
either directly or indirectly,`;
